My name is Pedro Pontes Garc√≠a, and I was born in northern Spain. I studied for most of my life in the region of Madrid, and three years ago I became the recipient of a UWC scholarship to finish high school in a remote international community by a fjord in western Norway.

Those two years in Norway shaped who I am today, and they also gave me access to the best education in terms of academic excellence but also, and perhaps most importantly, in terms of values.

A few months before graduating, I was admitted to Cornell University's class of 2026. I am currently a freshman at this wonderful institution which has become a home for me, and that lets my dreams and aspirations fly high.
