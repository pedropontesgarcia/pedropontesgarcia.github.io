            When people ask me about my favourite memory, many things come to my
            mind. I recall staring into the fjord that hosted me during the two
            most critical years of my life, listening to the subtle drumming of
            raindrops on the surface of the water; I also recall lying on thick
            snow, looking at early Norwegian sunsets surrounded by friends.

            , a school on a fjord, with two hundred students from ninety
            different countries. It was the place where I became who I am today,
            and it made me fall in love with diversity, with culture, with
            perspectives so far from my own that they made me question my own
            reality.

            I am originally from Madrid, Spain, where my wonderful family and
            friends raised me as an ever-curious inquirer, instilling in me a
            love of learning and discovering challenges. For me, Madrid is a
            beautiful classic city that brings me peace and makes me feel at
            home.

            After my time in Norway, I decided to continue my academic journey
            in two fields I love: Computer Science and Mathematics. There is
            something about proving a theorem in abstract algebra, or building a
            complex application that finally passes the test cases, that I find
            so exhilarating. I was admitted to{" "}

            under the Davis UWC Scholarship Program, and I&apos;ve had the
            pleasure to expand my academic and personal perspectives at the
            College of Arts and Sciences during the past two years.

            Cornell has a charmingly graceful campus, spanning hills, gorges,
            forests, fields, botanical gardens and stunning outlooks, as well as
            countless historical classroom halls, libraries, and museums. It is
            a place with its own soul, with a community of students dedicated to
            all kinds of academic disciplines.

          <p className="mb-5">
            And for me, as a prospective computer scientist and mathematician,
            Cornell offers an impressively qualified and renowned faculty,
            always willing to push my own boundaries while providing me with all
            the resources I need to succeed. On this campus, I have had some of
            the most critical academic experiences in my life, and I hope that
            Cornell continues to push me forward as I keep on pursuing my
            passion for learning.
