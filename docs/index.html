				<h1>3D terrain generation with <i>libGDX</i></h1>
				<p>Pursuing my interest in computer graphics, I have been on a journey through the world of 3D terrain
					generation using <a href="https://libgdx.com/" target="_blank">libGDX</a>, a Java-based lightweight
					game development framework. I have been working with height field generation and rendering, using
					triangle meshes, textures, height maps, and many concepts from linear algebra.</p>
				<p>This is an ongoing personal project that is helping me understand concepts in game development and 3D
					graphics, allowing me to apply all the theoretical knowledge I have gained in my coursework to a
					more hands-on scenario.</p>

				<h1>Building a 2D side-scroller engine in OCaml</h1>
				<p>Together with Luis Hern√°ndez Rocha and Bisola Okunola, I built a <a
						href="https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/pp457/cs3110-final" target="_blank">lightweight
						side-scroller engine</a>
					sitting atop SDL2. We completed this project for the course <a

					honors grades for it.</p>
				<p>Using a functional programming language to build a modern interactive application poses many
					challenges; the standard object-oriented model offers many seemingly desirable constructs that are
					nonexistent in stateless programming. However, <a href="https://www.defmacro.org/2006/06/19/fp.html"
						target="_blank">the functional paradigm</a> resolves many difficult issues that affect OOP,
					makes it easier to produce correct code, unlocks many benefits in concurrent programming, and it
					ultimately teaches programmers a different and fascinating way to understand computing.</p>

				<h1>Modelling pendulums</h1>
				<p>A simple pendulum seems to be in simple harmonic motion. The word <i>seems</i> is intentional: in
					reality, the circular nature of pendular motion complicates its analysis, and when the simple
					harmonic approximation is discarded, or when damping is considered, the differential model that
					emerges seems to evade analytic solutions.</p>
				<p>By introducing simple concepts from the field of differential equations, this paper sought to provide
					a critical evaluation of four different models of pendular motion, presenting closed-form solutions
					wherever possible, and otherwise providing simulations built using scientific computing tools.

				<h1>A tale of fjords, cities and mountains</h1>
				<p>When people ask me about my favourite memory, many things come to my mind. I recall staring into the
					fjord that hosted me during the two most critical years of my life, listening to the subtle drumming
					of raindrops on the surface of the water; I also recall lying on thick snow, looking at early
					Norwegian sunsets surrounded by friends.</p>
				<p>I had the privilege to spend two years of my life in one of the most <a href="photo/rcn/index.html">beautiful</a> places I will
					ever see: <a href="https://uwcrcn.no" target="_blank">UWC Red Cross Nordic</a>, a school on a fjord,
					with two hundred students from ninety different countries. It was the place where I became who I am
					today, and it made me fall in love with diversity, with culture, with perspectives so far from my
					own that they made me question my own reality.</p>
				<p>I am originally from Madrid, Spain, where my wonderful family and friends raised me as an
					ever-curious
					inquirer, instilling in me a love of learning and discovering challenges. For me, Madrid is a
					beautiful Neoclassical city that brings me peace and makes me feel at home.</p>
				<h1>Across the Atlantic</h1>
				<p>After my time in Norway, I decided to continue my academic journey in a field I love: Computer
					Science. There is something about proving a theorem in graph theory, or building a complex
					application that finally passes the test cases, that I find so exhilarating. I was admitted to
					<a href="https://cornell.edu" target="_blank">Cornell University</a> under the Davis UWC Scholarship
					Program, and I have had the pleasure to expand my academic and personal perspectives at the College
					of Arts and Sciences during the past year and a half.
				</p>
				<p>Cornell has a charmingly graceful campus, spanning hills, gorges, forests, fields, botanical
					gardens and stunning outlooks, as well as countless historical classroom halls, libraries, and
					museums. It is a place with its own soul, with a community of students dedicated to all kinds of
					academic disciplines.</p>
				<p>
					And for me, as a prospective computer scientist and mathematician, Cornell offers an
					impressively qualified and renowned faculty, always willing to push my own boundaries while
					providing me with all the resources I need to succeed. On this campus, I have had some of the most
					critical academic experiences in my life, and I hope that Cornell continues to push me forward as I
					keep on pursuing my passion for learning.</p>
