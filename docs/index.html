				<h1>A tale of fjords, cities and mountains</h1>
				<p>When people ask me about my favourite memory, many things come to my mind. I recall staring into the
					fjord that hosted me during the two most critical years of my life, listening to the subtle drumming
					of raindrops on the surface of the water; I also recall lying on thick snow, looking at early
					Norwegian sunsets surrounded by friends.</p>
				<p>I have had the privilege to spend two years of my life in one of the most beautiful places I will
					ever see: <a href="https://uwcrcn.no" target="_blank">UWC Red Cross Nordic</a>, a school on a fjord,
					with two hundred students from ninety different countries. It was the place where I became who I am
					today, and it made me fall in love with diversity, with culture, with perspectives so far from my
					own that they made me question my own reality.</p>
				<p>I am originally from Madrid, Spain, where my wonderful family and friends raised me as an
					ever-curious
					inquirer, instilling in me a love of learning and discovering challenges. For me, Madrid is a
					beautiful neoclassic city that brings me peace and makes me feel at home.</p>
				<h1>Across the Atlantic</h1>
				<p>After my time in Norway, I decided to continue my academic journey in a field I love: Computer
					Science. There is something about proving a theorem in graph theory, or building a complex
					application that finally passes the test cases, that I find so exhilarating. I was admitted to
					<a href="https://cornell.edu" target="_blank">Cornell University</a> under the Davis UWC Scholarship
					Program, and I have had the pleasure to expand my academic and personal perspectives at the College
					of Arts and Sciences during the past year and a half.
				</p>
				<p>Cornell has a charmingly graceful campus, which spans hills, gorges, forests, fields, botanical
					gardens and stunning outlooks, as well as countless historic classroom halls, libraries, and
					museums. It is a place with its own soul, with a community of students dedicated to all kinds of
					academic disciplines.</p>
				<p>
					And for me, as a prospective computer scientist, Cornell offers an
					impressively qualified and renowned faculty, always willing to push my own boundaries while
					providing me with all the resources I need to succeed. On this campus, I have had some of the most
					critical academic experiences in my life, and I hope that Cornell continues to push me forward as I
					keep on pursuing my passion for learning.</p>
